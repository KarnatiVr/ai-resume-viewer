**Overall Feedback**

Your resume is well-organized and provides a clear overview of your skills and experience. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

**Content**

* **Internships:** Quantify your accomplishments and highlight the specific impact of your work. For example, instead of "Worked on a web-based application," you could say "Developed a Python application that reduced data analysis time by 20%."
* **Skills & Proficiencies:** Add more detail to your technical skills. Instead of just listing "Python," specify your level of proficiency (e.g., "Proficient in Python with 3+ years of experience").
* **License & Certifications:** Move this section to the bottom of your resume.
* **Achievements & Awards:** Provide more context for your achievements. For example, instead of "Gold medal in Employability training classes," you could say "Gold medal recipient in Naandi Foundation's Employability training program, demonstrating exceptional skills in job readiness."

**Formatting**

* **Font:** Use a consistent font size and style throughout your resume.
* **Spacing:** Add more white space to make your resume easier to read.
* **Bullet Points:** Use consistent bullet points (e.g., dashes or circles) for each section.

**Other Suggestions**

* Consider including a brief summary statement at the top of your resume to highlight your key skills and career goals.
* Add a section for your Education.
* Proofread your resume carefully for any errors in grammar or spelling.
